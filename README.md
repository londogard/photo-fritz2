## About the project

This is a integration of ONNX with Kotlin JS.

In this project a Deep Learning (originally PyTorch) model is running 
directly inside the browser.

ONNX uses technologies such as WASM and WebGL to accelerate the inference.

The framework used is `fritz2`.


A fun project all in all!
